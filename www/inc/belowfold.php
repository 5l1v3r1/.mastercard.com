								<div class="padl">
									<p>While it's early days for the adoption of mobile payments globally, some markets are making progress toward attaining the right mix of market forces and consumer acceptance. That's among the top-level findings of the MasterCard Mobile Payments Readiness Index (MPRI), a data-driven survey of the global mobile payments landscape. Using public and proprietary data, as well as original market research, the survey gauges the preparedness and receptivity of 34 countries for mobile payments of three varieties &ndash; person to </p>

								<p>person (P2P), mobile e-commerce (m-commerce), and mobile payments at the point of sale (POS).</p>
								<p>The MPRI runs on a scale of zero to 100, with 100 representing complete replacement of plastic cards by mobile devices, an unlikely scenario. In MasterCard's judgment, the point of inflection&mdash;the stage at which mobile devices account for an appreciable share of the payments mix&mdash;is a Mobile Readiness score of 60. The 34 countries in the current Index achieved an average score of 33.2. No market reached 50, indicating there is work to be done before mobile payments become mainstream.</p>

								<h4>M-Commerce<br />Leads</h4>

								<h4>Different Segments,<br />Different Needs</h4>

										<p><a href="/country/?ke">Kenyan</a> consumers' very high levels of familiarity with and frequent usage of mobile payments make the east African nation the top scorer on the Consumer Readiness component. Consumer Readiness scores are driven in large part by how frequently mobile payments are currently in use. In countries around the world, m-commerce and P2P payments lead the way at this early stage of market development. In Kenya, due to the popularity of P2P payment services &ndash; especially M-Pesa &ndash; 89 percent of Kenyans are familiar with mobile P2P payments and 68 percent are frequent users.</p>

Notably, nine of the top 10 countries in this component hail from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, indicating this region offers many of the best mobile payment opportunities over the next few years.</p>

However, in Canada, cooperation between banks and mobile networks is unique: In 2011, major mobile network <a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal">Rogers</a> filed to be a bank under the Canada Bank Act. This move has the potential to create big opportunities for mobile NFC payments in Canada by integrating the telco and financial services aspects of mobile payments in one entity.</p>
